# desc-lint.sh — frontmatter description-length lint (three-tier caps).
#
# Frontmatter descriptions are AMBIENT: Claude Code injects them into every
# session's startup context in every project with the plugin enabled.
# Multi-line YAML scalars (`description: |` / `>`) hide overruns from
# single-line greps — this lint joins continuation lines before measuring.
# A file with NO frontmatter (e.g. agents/_base/frontend-agent.md) has nothing
# to lint and is skipped silently — absence is not a violation.
#
# All three caps are REGRESSION BRAKES set just above this repo's current
# reality, NOT targets. They freeze the status quo so descriptions cannot grow
# unnoticed; tightening toward the ~250 ideal is an eval-gated follow-up (does
# a shorter description still route/fire correctly?), never a blind edit here.
#
#   agents/**          → 400  — current max ~369 (fe-test-generator). EIGHT
#                               agents already exceed 250, so the sibling
#                               plugins' 250 cap would fail this repo today;
#                               the 250-target diet is deferred, do not tighten.
#   commands/**        → 250  — current max ~213, green; this tier holds the
#                               CC ~250 guidance since commands fit under it.
#   skills/**/SKILL.md → 500  — current max ~460 (typescript-skills). Skill
#                               descriptions are deliberately trigger-engineered
#                               (they must fire the right skill), so this brake
#                               sits just above the worst — a diet pending
#                               measured trigger evals, do not tighten without
#                               evidence a shorter description still fires.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/desc-lint.sh              # lint agents/**, commands/**, skills/**/SKILL.md
#   scripts/desc-lint.sh <file> [...] # lint specific files
#   scripts/desc-lint.sh --self-test  # verify the parser against inline fixtures
#
# Exit codes: 0 = all within cap, 1 = at least one over cap, 2 = usage/parser error.
#
# CI / repo-maintenance helper only — never read by agents at runtime.
